The individual files must be activated in the following order: 
1. datapreperation 
2. extract_interpol_grid
3. calculate_timeseries 		
4. difference_calculation
5. extract elevation
6. display_data 

If maps/histograms are to be created for 2H, O18 must be replaced by H2 using Ctrl F.

This code was created as part of the work: 'The influence of climate change on the δ18O and δ2H signatures of meteoric waters in Europe and North America' by Weisser et. al. (2023).
